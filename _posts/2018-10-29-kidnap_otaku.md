title: Kidnapping the Otaku
---

We got hired by the evil AI to be on call to destroy a building where some doctor was doing
horrible experiments, so they loaded us up with a bunch of explosives and a flamethrower.
Then we got a call from Overwatch that there was a load of children that got rescued from
the Renraku arcology, and one of them was one of Deus’ otaku, and they wanted us to recover
that child. In front of a room full of children, Evan says that if we need to knock out the
otaku, he’ll just punch him in the face, which really pisses off ex-nanny Pary Moppins. So
we got my favorite armored cab driver Raul to drive us over to the place where Overwatch
had arranged a roadblock so the convoy would have to stop. We waited, the roadblock went off
without a hitch, the three-car convoy decides to go around. (The convoy is one escort car
in front, an armored vans with kids in the middle, escort car in the back.) Clem badly damages
a tire of the front car, Evan tries and misses, so Pary shotguns the tire to finish the job.
The entire convoy stops, so Clem provides cover fire (read: wipes out pretty much everything
in sight) while Derrick (I’m totally drawing a blank on his character name) staggers around
because magic something-something and Pary Moppins runs up to the side of the van to get
ready to jump in once Evan (the only one with electronics skills, apparently) gets the door
unlocked. Evan fumbles with the lock for a good long while, so Pary tries to help but drops
the passkey under the van (curse those tricky glitches). Clem sees the fumble and runs over
and just starts to rip the door off the side of the van. Pary helps, they get it, there’s a
guy inside with a large gun pointed at them! So Pary shotguns him but doesn’t kill him, Clem
continues to cover the van from pretty much all directions, Derrick continues to stumble,
and Evan verbally runs around like a chicken with his head cut off. Clem finishes off the
guy in the van, Pary shotguns the driver (lots of blood and gore spatter) and shoves his
corpse out of the driver’s seat so she can drive, and everyone hops in the van. Pary, despite
her alleged skill at driving, was having a really rough go, so Clem drove instead, and the
party escaped!

Highlights that didn’t fit super well in the flow of the narrative:
- Evan wanted to threaten the driver of the armored van with a pistol
- Evan wanted to toss kids out the back of the _moving_ van once we scanned them and found they weren’t the otaku
- Pary threatened to shotgun Evan at least once, but I kind of think it was twice
- Real-life Russ got some _really_ good burns in
