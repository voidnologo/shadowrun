title: "The Scrapyard Part 1: Creeping Through Garbage"
---

Our adventure began outside a loud and smelly scrap metal processing plant. Following the
death of Morris, Overwatch requested that the team investigate a possible location of
Morris's former office. After standing around and talking about nothing basically forever,
the team parked the van behind some conveniently-placed piles of rubble off to one side
of the plant. Rhineholt levitated the group over the fence into a hidden area behind a wall
made of re-purposed metal (for bad guys, at least they seem pretty environmentally
friendly), and they started to creep around the edge of the compound.

After turning the first corner, Rhineholt snagged his clothes on some metal (dang fancy
wizard robes) and brought a section of the precariously-piled metal wall down. The noise
alerted a patrolling guard, who whirled round to see naught but an orc with his hands raised
in surrender. "Sorry!" Clem called, putting on his most innocent expression. "I'm just
looking for a catalytic converter!"

Of course, if you've seen the most innocent of expression of an orc, you'll know exactly
what happened next. The guard pulled his gun and somehow managed to hit the massive orc
standing right out in the open in the only-semi-darkness, so Clem pulled out his SMG and
mowed down the puny human. The group came out of hiding and continued to creep along the
pathway.

Before they could even get to the next bend in the path, the group was brought to their
knees by the howl of a barghest. Stuffing random bits of scavenged cloth into their ears to
muffle the sound, the group continued their journey to the center of the scrap yard.

As they rounded the next bend, there was the sound of shifting metal, and a giant scorpion-esque
drone rose from the closest pile of metal. Rhineholt threw magic at the drone while Clem, Pary,
and Ryzel fired at the drone. The scorpion grabbed Ryzel with one giant claw just before a
well-placed shot finished it off. Clem tried to pry the claw open to rescue the decker, but
a sudden shift of the metal buried the scorpion and Ryzel along with it.

As the team took a moment of silence for their fallen comrade, the barghest cried from the
direction of the fallen security guard.
