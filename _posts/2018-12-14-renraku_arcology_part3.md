title: Mouse Trap. You Roll Your Dice, You Move Your Mice... Nobody Gets Hurt.
---

Our adventure began on the 199th floor of the Renraku Arcology. The runners were met by
the resistance and were promptly escorted to the nearest entertainment district. Some guy
named Devin and an elf whose name escapes me at the moment met the group in a bar and pulled
up maps of floors 201, 202, and 272 on a projector. They explained that Cham, one of the
men involved in building DEUS, was imprisoned on floor 272 with the Mousetrap, which was
necessary to imprison DEUS. After freeing Cham and acquiring the Mousetrap, the runners
would need to go to floor 201 to restore the breathable atmosphere on floor 202. Then, they
could take the Mousetrap to floor 202, where the resistance would use it to jack into the
mainframe and trap DEUS.

The runners made it up to floor 272 without incident. Clem, leading the way to Cham's door,
strutted down the hall singing, "Cham too sexy for this suite, too sexy for this suite..."
Stepping into the room, he pointed finger guns at the man he assumed to be Cham and finished
his song with a whispered "Sexy..." The blue banded guarding Cham, being responsible guards,
asked who Clem was.

Clem responded, "I'm too sexy for a name."

As Clem reached back to draw his gun, he lost his sexy and looked completely foolish. Pary
and Rhineholt, shocked by their friend's sudden loss of what had quickly become such an
essential part of him, were moved into inaction.

"I'm not sexy anymore, not sexy anymore..."

Clem fired at the non-banded guy who was standing with the banded, who flew back into the
wall and collapsed in what we can only imagine was a world of pain. The first banded pulled
out a shotgun, and the second banded pulled out some kind of fancy gun whose name I totally
missed. Clem obliterated the guy with the shotgun and insta-killed the guy with the fancy
gun.

At this moment, Pary recovered her ability to act. With one smooth motion, she unholstered
her shotgun and fired at the guy collapsed against the wall. A beam of light shone down
from Heaven, accompanied by the sound of angels singing, as the man died in an explosion
of blood and guts.

With a smirk, Pary declared, "I'm sexy and I know it."

Clem turned on the jammer that he had the foresight to bring, allowing Cham to leave his
prison despite his fancy house arrest anklet. The runners and Cham ran back to the elevator.
As the elevator doors opened, the team was met by an elevator full of banded blues who
were too distracted by Pary's sexiness to open fire. The quick-thinking team ducked into
the stairs next to the elevator and ran downstairs with Cham in tow.

A while later, the runners reached floor 201 to discover a dead orc in a Renraku jumpsuit
and a kid (think 'young punk', not 'literal child') with blue hair. The kid said that his
name was Sebastian, that he was on the side of the resistance, and that he was the one who
took out the orc. He also told the runners that the gas valves connected to floor 202
should only be lightly guarded.

The team located the door to the gas control room without incident. Pary pulled out a key
sequencer and used it to unlock the door. As the door swung open, a Medusa drone leapt out
from the room beyond to stab Pary in the chest. With a cry of rage, Clem drew his SMG and
fired on the drone. The Medusa whipped its tail forward in an attempt to grab Clem, who
twisted out of its grasp in the nick of time. Pary, somehow still standing, drew her shotgun
and shot the Medusa, only succeeding in making it angry. Clem took another shot at the
Medusa, and the Medusa swung its tails at him, managing to sting him with its taser
attachment. The Medusa blew up as it was met with one more shell from Pary's shotgun.

Rhineholt, who was the only one who managed to keep his wits about him upon the appearance
of the Medusa, spotted a maintenance spider coming from the other room and drew his pistol.
Clem sprayed bullets into the air in the general direction of the maintenance spider,
still trying to shake off his confusion, luscious locks flowing like a shampoo commercial.

As Pary and Clem finished off the maintenance spider, Rhineholt and Sebastian started
fiddling with the gas valves. They must have done something right, because the atmosphere
on the next floor improved dramatically.

On their way back to the stairs, Sebastian told the runners that he had one more thing he
wanted to show them. He entered the code to a nearby door, and the runners were shocked
to find a room full of meta-humans. Each was connected to machinery with fiber optic
cables; some wore expressions of anguish. As the runners took in the scene with horror,
Sebastian struggled to apologize through his tears. Blood began to leak from his eyes,
ears, and nose, and he collapsed to the floor, dead. The runners were all hit with a
sudden wave of dizziness, falling into a faint one by one.
