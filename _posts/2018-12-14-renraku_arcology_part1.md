title: Escalators Go Up
---

Our adventure began in an Overwatch safehouse. The team was informed that they would need
to take Mr. A (now that I know how to spell his name, we'll call him Aneki) into the arcology
with them so that he could enter the kill codes for DEUS. Overwatch suggested that the
team take advantage of Seattle's illustrious and exclusive orc underground to gain entrance
to the arcology and, due to an incoming military offensive within the arcology, recommended
that the runners get their crap together and head in quickly.

As the runners went about their days, gathering supplies, thinking through plans, buying
massive amounts of grenades, things started to get weird. Fixers that had been cooperative
in the past started to get antsy and backed out of deals. Rhineholt got home one day to
discover that his house had been broken into, and all three runners got the odd feeling
that someone was watching them.

On The Day, the runners - accompanied by Ronan, Dodger, and Aneki - found themselves being
escorted through the elegant and awe-inspiring Orc Underground by Tholm the troll and Slant
the orc. Upon slipping through a manhole into The Underground, the runners discovered
that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. In fact, the tunnels were really pretty gross
(like you'd expect from a tunnel, if we're honest). After traipsing through the tunnels
for a good bit, Tholm and Slant left the team at the entrance to a freshly-dug, well-lit
tunnel, telling them that the tunnel lead to level B4, and that any signs of a fight would
trigger an emergency (and quite permanent) closing of the tunnel.

After dropping through a hole in the ceiling into the corner of an underground parking
garage, the runners were met by the sight of Medusa drones chasing terrified soldiers
through the parking garage. The runners dove behind some nearby cars, hoping to avoid the
scuffle. In her hurry to save her own behind, Pary bumped into poor unsuspecting Ronan,
who stumbled out of cover and into the path of the oncoming drones. The drones, shocked
and slightly embarrassed at the sight of Ronan in the open, turned their attention towards
the team.

Medusa One (MO) leaped at the car sheltering the runners, crushing in the side and shattering
glass from the windows. Medusa Two (MT) vaulted onto the top of the car and reached out for
Clem with dual scorpion tails. Completely distracted by the sight of the beauteous creature
before her (or something), MT missed completely. Clem grabbed her (its?) tail as it swung
past and shot it (her?) with his SMG. MT, spraying fluid from various places, reared back
in rage as MO scrambled around the side of the car and snapped menacingly at Rhineholt with
its arms. Pary pulled out her shotgun and shot MT, who retaliated by lunging forward to
snap at her. Pary dodged out of the way, and Clem took another shot at MT, destroying the
drone. Meanwhile, MO whipped her tail forward to grab Rhineholt, who dodged the attack like a pro.
Clem, who apparently has this thing about shooting things while they're distracted, shot
at MO and finished it off.

Having fought off the immediate danger, the runners turned their attention to the rest of
the parking garage, where two soldiers were still fighting off (more or less), a couple
Manta drones. (To be more accurate, one soldier was fleeing a Manta, and the other one
had already lost.) Clem shot down the pursuing Manta, and the fleeing soldier asked the
team for helping reconnecting with the other soldiers. The runners agreed on the condition
that he would help them sneak past the other military forces. After a bit of hesitation,
the soldier agreed, and the runners (plus Ronan, Dodger, and Aneki, who have done _nothing_
useful up to this point) set off into the arcology.

Not far into the arcology, the runners and their guide spot some soldiers patrolling in
front of a stairway. Soldier Fren bid the team a tearful adieu (not really) and led his
buddies down an adjacent hallway (or something), so that the runners could sneak up the
stairs and away into the upper floors of Renraku.

As the runners ascended, the extent of the chaos that had overtaken the Renraku arcology
became apparent. Death and destruction reigned on most floors. More than once, the
runners rounded a corner to be met with piles of decaying corpses. Other floors were
spotless, apparently untouched by the madness that had been unleashed.

Upon reaching the end of a staircase on the 40th floor, the runners were creeping along
down an abandoned hallway, innocently looking for the next available stairway, when they
noticed some skittering sounds from up ahead of them. As they proceeded down the hallway,
they could hear the skittering getting closer but couldn't detect a visible threat.

The lights went out as the runners reached the halfway point of the hall. At the end of
the hall, they could _just_ make out a glass double door. The team rushed to the door only
to find it locked. The skittering was getting closer. Rhineholt leaned against the glass
and peered down, allowing him to use magic fingers on the push bar on the other side of
the door. After a few minutes of intense concentration, the door suddenly swung open,
bloodying Rhineholt's nose and knocking him backwards into Ronan (that poor guy). There
was a moment of ominous silence followed by a loud skittering and the sound of alarms.

The team bolted through the open door, letting it slam shut behind them. The area before
them was cold, dark, and foreboding. They found themselves standing in what appeared to
be a large common area, surrounded by apartment doors. Wandering the hallways at random,
they eventually found themselves on the first floor of a shopping mall. Pary, hoping that
Aneki was having a lucid moment, asked him for directions. Aneki's eyes brightened for a
few moments, and he rambled on about all the amenities available to those who lived and
worked in the arcology, then pointed out that there were elevators at the top of the
escalators to the left. Clem asked (as nicely as a barbarian can) for further directions,
and Aneki shut back down, mumbling something that sounded like "Escalators go up..."

The team stealthily started up the escalators, but pulled up short at the sound of murmuring
voices. The sound was vaguely humanoid, but there was just something a little _off_. Pary
(with that familiar mad gleam in her eye), lit up her flamethrower (you know, just in
case), and the team continued upward.

At the top of the escalator, the team found themselves at the edge of what had once been
a standard mall food court. Instead of being met by the sight of people eating and the
deliciously disgusting smell of mall food, they were met by a group of figures in ragged
clothing huddling around a table, presumably feasting on whatever they surrounded. Pary,
realizing that the creatures in front of them were ghouls and that there weren't _that
many_ of them, lit the whole group on fire. The flaming ghouls screeched and ran away, and
Pary felt pretty darn proud of herself.

For a moment.

As the screeching of the ghouls faded away, it was replaced by a rumbling murmur, which
was followed by the sight of ghouls swarming in from every edge of the food court. The
now-outnumbered team darted towards the elevators. Clem immediately began to pry the doors
open while Rhineholt and Pary assumed positions to provide cover fire. Rhineholt tossed an
incendiary grenade into the oncoming wave of ghouls; it skittered into a table before
bouncing into the ghouls. The explosion lit the ghouls closest to the grenade on fire, but
more ghouls continued on, streaming around their burning allies.

Clem managed to pop open the left door to the elevator. On the other side of the door, he
found an empty elevator shaft with a maintenance ladder attached to the right hand side of
the shaft. Realizing that the ladder was unreachable until the right side door was open,
he turned his attention to the other door. Meanwhile, Rhineholt lobbed another incendiary
grenade into the mass of ghouls, starting a fire that spread from ghoul to ghoul. At this
point, the ghouls (bright creatures that they were) decided that their chances might be
better if they stopped coming in one massive drove, so they drew back a bit to start
flanking the runners.

Clem pulled open the other elevator door and helped Ronan, Dodger, Aneki, and Rhineholt
onto the ladder while Pary provided cover fire courtesy of the flamethrower. Clem pulled
Pary away from a pyromaniac's wildest dream to put her on the ladder beneath Rhineholt,
then jumped for the ladder himself. As he swung into position on the ladder, the first
of the ghouls reached the elevator door and dramatically plummeted down the elevator
shaft. Clem hurled an incendiary grenade back into the group of ghouls before following
his teammates up the ladder. The runner's way higher into the arcology was lit only by
the flaming waterfall of ghouls below.
