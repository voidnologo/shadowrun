title: Griffins Sound Like Pterodactyls
---

Our adventure began in the center of DEUS's virtual world. As the runners gazed around at
the massive amount of trees and the beautiful blue sky above, Dodger (who we definitely
didn't forget about and has totally been here the whole time) announced that he was calling
for reinforcements. The runners, spotting a path, started following it through the garden.
Dodger, who we assume had finished calling for reinforcements at this point, pulled out
what appeared to be an old-fashioned dowsing rod to find a portal. The rod twitched and
pointed into the undergrowth to the left of the path, so the team decided to trust this
sketchy thing and head off through the foliage.

Hoping to make the way easier for everyone, Clem swung his axe into the undergrowth, causing
the crystal plants to shatter and splinter everywhere. Grudgingly, the team began their
trudge through the undergrowth. Clem started to go a little crazy as they passed through
the trees, seeing nests of chromatic snakes hiding in a tree, waiting to bite unsuspecting
passers-by. Up ahead, the team could see a triangle shape made of pulsating light in the
branches. Dodger's Delightful Dowsing Rod pointed directly into the center of the triangle.

As Clem stepped through the triangle, Pary and Rhineholt heard "Weeeeeeell that sucks."
Hoping that Clem hadn't found himself in too much danger, Pary and Rhineholt followed the
orc into the triangle. Rhineholt found himself knee-deep in red goop. Pary (being much
shorter, because she's a dwarf) was waist-deep in the substance. The team looked around
and decided that they must be in some sort of a rounded tunnel. The surrounding air stunk
terribly, and large blobs of red started bumping into the team as they tried to decide on
a next course of action.

The runners had no sooner started wandering down the tunnel than they heard a rushing sound
behind them and noticed that the current through the red goop was starting to get stronger.
Not sure what to expect, they started to run. A couple moments later, they glanced over
their shoulders to see a large wall of goop gaining on them. Clem unsheathed his axe and
cut a hole in the fleshy wall of the tunnel. As Clem tossed Dodger through the hole he had
cut, Rhineholt cut a second hole with his katana and hopped through. Pary struggled to
climb through behind Clem (curse those stubby legs of hers), but the orc managed to grab
her and pull her through just before the massive wave swept through the place they had
been standing. Red goop squirted through the freshly-cut holes as the wave hurtled past,
drenching the team.

Wiping the goop off themselves, the team realized that they were squished in a gap between
thick slimy tubes. Dodger's dowsing rod pointed into the center of the sticky tubes. The
team decided that they would rather fight the red goop than the icky tubes and slipped
back into the tunnel. A moment later, the runners heard the rushing sound again and felt
the current picking up. Clem opened another hole, and the team slipped back out into the
midst of the tubes. After quite a while of Clem elbowing his way through the piles of tubes
to make a path for the others, they found themselves at a point where big and little tubes
seemed to come together. Clem hacked in with his axe, and the team was surprised to find
a pool of the red goop in the center, swirling downwards toward the center like a flushing
toilet. Clem hopped into the pool and swirled around and around, flashing a thumbs up as
he sank into the middle. Pary, Dodger, and Rhineholt followed, though with noticeably fewer
thumbs up.

The team sunk further and further down. Just as their lungs started to feel like they would
burst, when they didn't think they could possibly hold their breath for another second,
they felt the rush of a mountain breeze and heard the flapping of large wings. Looking
around in confusion, the runners soon realized that they were riding on the backs of a
herd of Pegasus. Behind them was a flock of Griffins, closing in quickly.

Luckily for the runners, Rhineholt had read quite a few fantasy novels in his spare time
and seemed to remember the characters riding Pegasus on a few occasions. He reached up
and grasped the ears of his Pegasus, using them to control the creature's movement. Pary,
over the moon at riding on one of the best mythical creatures of all time ever, clutched
the mane of her Pegasus excitedly. The Pegasus was equally as excited to discover that it
was being ridden by one of the best meta-humans of all time ever, started doing barrel
rolls and crazy stunt tricks through the sky.

Dodger called out to the runners that the dowsing rod was pointing to the left. Clem and
Rhineholt (Pary was too busy bonding with her Pegasus) looked to the left to see what should
have been the familiar skyline of Seattle. This skyline, though, showed destroyed skyscrapers
overgrown by vegetation. The only recognizable structure still standing was the Space Needle,
which was their apparent target. Now having a definite direction, Clem reached forward with
one meaty hand to grasp the head of his Pegasus, using it like a joystick. Pary's Pegasus
pulled itself out of a barrel roll and rocketed past the other flying horses, Pary whooping
and flashing the "rock on" symbol at her companions as they passed.

Hearing the Griffins getting ever closer, the team steered their mounts closer to the ground,
weaving in and out of the buildings and zigging when they could have zagged and what-not.
Eventually, they spotted an open intersection ahead of them, free of rubble. Some quick
and totally-not-made-up calculations showed that they would likely be caught by the Griffins
on the other side of the intersection.

(At this point in the narrative, the GM asked me to note that his inner pterodactyl died,
and all that was left was the longing to hear the cry of his people.)

As their Pegasus entered the intersection, the team bailed off, hitting the ground running.
They darted into a nearby deserted department store and dove behind the perfume counter.
As Clem started to toss perfume bottles at the Griffins, Pary and Rhineholt dug through
some debris and unearthed a Vigorous Assault Cannon with five rounds. The Griffins, grossed
out by the smell of the perfume, flew away to go find private places to throw up, and
the team scrambled out of the building and headed in the general direction the Space Needle.

As the runners started to climb the ruins of the Space Needle, the ground trembled, and a
ferocious roar echoed around them. A large lizard-like head appeared over the skyline as a
huge Godzilla-like creature stomped towards the team, looking particularly hungry. Pary
handed the big gun to Clem, who swung around towards Godzilla excitedly, startling an
especially flinchy Rhineholt in the process. As the first round from the gun crashed into
the monster, Godzilla roared angrily and shot a burst of fire into the air demonstratively.
Another round met its target, and Godzilla shot a huge ball of fire towards the runners.
As it approached, Clem ducked behind a nearby wall, Pary flattened herself to the ground,
and Rhineholt and Dodger dove into an overturned dumpster. The heat from the fire singed
them all as it sailed past.

At that moment, a large crevice opened up in the ground, and the team jumped through
gratefully. The crevice closed behind them, leaving the runners in an underground parking
garage. Abandoned cars littered the area, and the team could see large eggs underneath
giant nets. As the team passed a cluster of eggs, they became aware of a cracking sound
and noticed that the eggs were quivering as if they could hatch any moment. The runners
hurried away from the eggs and heard a pterodactyl-ish scream from behind them. Pary pointed
Dodger towards a vault door in the wall, and the dowsing rod went nuts.

"I might know the combination, but my axe knows another."

Pary and Rhineholt, rolling their eyes at Clem's latest one-liner, helped the orc start to
pry open the door. Clem heard the monsters gaining on them and handed Pary the big gun
before straining harder at the door. Rhineholt threw throwing knives into the oncoming
wave of lizard-alligator-looking things. Pary took a shot with the big gun, but miscalculated
something or other, and the roof collapsed. Falling pieces of debris hit Pary and Rhineholt
on the heads, knocking them out instantly. Clem tossed a teammate over each shoulder, and
he and Dodger stepped into the vault.

The vault was full of drones that shuddered but couldn't quite seem to start. Sparkling
light swirled before Clem and Dodger as the floor collapsed, dumping the group into darkness.
